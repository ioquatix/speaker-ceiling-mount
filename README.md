# Speaker Ceiling Mount

This repository contains a part for mounting speakers to the ceiling. The speaker must have a 18x45mm to attach the mounts.

## Motivation

I wanted to get my speakers off the floor, but the ceiling wasn't very easy to mount things to, so I designed a custom interface between the wooden surround of the speaker and the ceiling. The parts were designed to facilitate the mounting process.

## Parts Required

- 4x 75mm countersunk wood screws.
- 1x 40mm countersunk wood screw (for the center)
- 1x 80mm countersunk wood screw.

## Instructions

1. You need to mount a frame of 18x45mm around the speaker. I do this to avoid directly attaching or screwing into the speaker.
2. Then, attach the mounting brackets to the ceiling. Use the center hole first to position the mount, use a free piece of wood between two brackets, and then use screws in all the remaining outer holes.
3. Lift the speaker into the bracket, and screw in the horizontal screws.
